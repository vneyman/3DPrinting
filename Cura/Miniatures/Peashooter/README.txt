# Summary

It's time for another Plants vs Zombies character! This time I'm doing the Peashooter! Check out the video here for a closer look: https://youtu.be/QpMqgUU2H5Y 

I created this model in Fusion 360 using forms to create most of the body shapes. Then I used sketches to carve out the final details. It took about 5 hours to model. After that I sent it to my Robo3D R1 printer. It took roughly 6 hours to print.

Then I handed it off to my wife and she did the post processing. She sanded and cleaned any rough spots. Then she primed it with automotive fill primer before sanding again to get a really smooth finish. After that she used a combination of an airbrush and water based acrylic paints with paintbrushes to paint it. Then she sprayed it with a matte finish just to seal it up and give a little extra protection.
